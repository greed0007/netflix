***Problem Statement:****

In March 2021, Netflix announced that it would be cracking down on password sharing as a way to address revenue loss and improve user security. Netflix in February outlined password-sharing protocols for users in Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain that call for users to set a “primary location” for their Netflix accounts — and that add additional monthly fees for out-of-household “sub accounts.By analyzing historical stock data and taking into account the changes in the password sharing policy, I aim to build a predictive model that forecast the stock performance of Netflix. The project aims to provide a valuable insight for stakeholders interested in understanding the impact of Netflix's new password sharing policy on its stock performance.
